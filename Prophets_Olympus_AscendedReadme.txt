				V0.9125 Reduced Values Release
	Reduced spawn chances for workshop creatures and dracs and a few other creatures.

Prophet's Olympus Ascended 	V0.85 Initial Release
	Adds creatures from both Styx and Prometheus to Olympus, attempting to fit them in where sort of apropriate. The Riverlands has become a bit more saturated in water, so a more swamp-like environment is to be expected.
	Some ill-fated prospectors never made it off the surface again, leaving their pets to fend for themselves.
